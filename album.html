            Castles is a special track. No overthinking just in the creative
            zone. Overall is less then twenty minutes. From the reversed
            melodies to the switches and hard basslines the track all the track
            is missing is a major artist to do their thing on it!

            Michael Jordan one of my personal favorites from this compilation.
            The process was unique from what I usually do when creating as
            originally it had started with a drum groove them built melodies
            from the patterns and added onto the drums later on. Lastly what
            stood out to me is the leads I played it on my laptop keyboard and
            was messing around until something sparked an idea.
